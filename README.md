Summary
=======

Node.js service to provide synergy connector for CardDav and CalDav.

In its current status it is quite functional.

Currently working:
* Two way sync of contacts and calendar entries
* Periodic sync
* Sync on local changes
* OAuth authorization (currently only Google)
* MDigest authorization
* Retries for downloads and uploads after failed syncs
* Auto discovery of c+dav URLs or setting URL using a list of known servers
* An app to show some statistics and sync status

Roadmap would look roughly like this:
* Add tasks support via calDAV VTODO items
* Improve VCard and VEVENT compability

No timeline is given for this. Pull requests are always welcome.
