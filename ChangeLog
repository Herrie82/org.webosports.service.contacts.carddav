0.2.2:
	o Added messages to enyo-app, that it is not to be run manually, at this point in time
    o Added another stage to mojo-app to allow some recovering stuff like trigger slow sync.
    o Cleaned up auto discovery and added possible support for iCloud.
    o Changed host/port/protocol stuff in Caldav.js, now should work fine with multiple servers
    o Caldav.js now also reacts to connection issue with server other than send timeout.
    o Added urlscheme.js as place to store known server configs in. These do not require a discovery anymore, fallback is implemented, though.
    o Prevent local duplicates if upload (or download of etag) did not work.
    o Prevent endless loop during redirections to always the same URL.
    o Download 10 items at one time, which keeps memory footprint low  even for massive downsyncs.
	o Changed back sync activity to "sync" which will sync contacts and calendar on periodic sync
	o Overwrite "complete" in syncAssistant and allow installation of multiple "SyncOnEdit" activities.
