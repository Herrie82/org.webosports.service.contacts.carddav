Summary
=======

Node.js service to provide synergy connector for CardDav and CalDav.

In its current status it is partly functional.

Currently working:
* One way sync of contacts and calendar entries from server
* Periodic sync

Roadmap would look roughly like this:
* Implement two way sync
* Add tasks support via calDAV VTODO items

No timeline is given for this. Pull requests are always welcome.
